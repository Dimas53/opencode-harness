### `new` flow — restructure into a single coherent mechanism

- **scripts/init-project.sh** — added `--no-open` flag. The script now copies
  `templates/` into the project, runs `git init` + hooks, and (unless
  `--no-open`) launches OpenCode with the `agent-new-project.md` prompt. Used
  by the `new` flow from inside an already-running OpenCode session so it does
  not spawn a second instance.
- **global/skills/harness-init/agent-new-project.md** — restructured into three
  phases:
  - **Phase 0 — Scaffold:** runs `make init PROJECT="$(pwd)" --no-open` BEFORE
    the interview, so `HARNESS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`,
    `memory/` and the `docs/` tree always exist in the new project.
  - **Phase 1 — Interview + fill:** fixed question order (Q1 name/purpose,
    Q2 team/auth, Q3 stage/deploy, Q4 integrations/sensitive, Q5 design/fields,
    Q6 plan) plus HARNESS questions (critical paths, risk levels). Mandatory
    restate (step 4.5) with explicit "yes" before any file is written. Fills or
    rewrites the scaffolded template files in place — no generate-from-scratch.
  - **Phase 2 — Hand-off:** formatted report listing created files and
    instructing the user to open a new session and type `start` (continues from
    roadmap M1). `new` is scaffold + docs only; project implementation happens
    in the next session.
- **templates/AGENTS.md** — restored to a PROJECT skeleton (placeholders only).
  It had been accidentally overwritten with the global AGENTS.md; now it no
  longer creates a redundant mirror in every new project.
- **templates/docs/CONTEXT.md** and **templates/docs/roadmap.md** — cleaned of
  example domain data (Cook / Deduction / Hetzner / Tailwind). Structure plus an
  instruction comment only; the agent rewrites them with the project's own
  context during the interview.

### Root cause fixed

The `new` shortcut previously generated only 6 documentation files and missed
`HARNESS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `memory/` because the
skill never called `make init` and ignored `templates/`. The `new` flow now
drives the scaffold through `make init`, then fills it via interview.
